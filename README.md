# C_BINARY.H
 C Macro Library that allows for a binary vs. standard hex. Useful for educational purposes such as teaching first time programmers without having to also teach hex, which can be complicated for a first time programmer in a classroom setting. This is not for real world application, but it could be used in production (or pissing off your boss).
